# classgrouping


##Grouping members for my class on my Data Structure II class to do a project

	I completed this task on the advice of my teacher Mr.Jiang(Datastructure2),
we try to make the evaluation of competencies among all groups to be balanced, and the preference value cannot be low. 


##Collected data

	1.Grade of every classmate to quantify programming capabilities(num=24) 
	2.24*24 each person to person preference value(score[24][24])
	Of course, I have upload the not actual data file.


##If you need to divided differen number for grouping,we confirm that the program may running a long time (one hour,etc) before you find the best parameter

	I thank you very much for optimizing this algorithm.I only do a little exploration.
