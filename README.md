# ClassGrouping


## Purpose

* Grouping members to do project 

* Making the evaluation of `competencies`  to be balanced, and the `preference` value cannot be low every group
	
	

## Collected data

* Grade of every classmate to quantify programming `capabilities`(num=24) 
	
* 24*24 each person to person `preference` value(score[24][24])
	
Of course, I have uploaded the not actual data file.

## Usage
```
	$ gcc -o main main.c
	$ ./main x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7
```
* xi is double type for `filtering` the optimal value
	
##  Note

we confirm that the program may running a long time (one hour,etc) before you find the best parameter if you need to divided differen number for grouping.

I completed this task on the advice of my teacher `Mr.Jiang`(Data Structure II) and expected you to optimize this algorithm and come up with new one.
